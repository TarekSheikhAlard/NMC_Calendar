 This project focuses on the development of a Task Management Calendar, tailored to enhance scheduling efficiency and task organization within NMC. Built using Power Platform tools and integrated with Dynamics CRM, the calendar provides a user-friendly interface with the following key features:

1- Create Tasks: Users can easily create new tasks, specifying details such as due dates, priorities, and assigned personnel.
2- Shift Tasks with Drag-and-Drop: Tasks can be intuitively moved and rescheduled by dragging and dropping them to specific times on the calendar, providing flexibility in task management.
3- Multiple Views: The calendar offers various viewing options, including weekly, monthly, and daily task views, allowing users to manage their schedules according to their preferences.
